## UselessTriangeImageTool
A short python program that has no use other than to create an image consisting of triangles in 3 colors. I wrote it to create the image I currently use as the background image on my website. Maybe I'll do some more things with it in the future...

## 8PuzzleSolvers
Solves an 8-puzzle as a search problem, using either Breadth First Search, Depth First Search, A\*-Star or Hill Climbing Algorithms. The latter two use the Manhattan Distance as a Heuristic.
